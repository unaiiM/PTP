- Implement CONNECT in local https proxy
- Change HTTPS local proxy to SOCKS, some browsers don't trust the certificate idk why
- Before start the local proxy check tor
- If some error is vinculed with tor connection, then stop the proxy and just wait to start up it again.
- Check a lot of error handling

// curl --proxy-insecure -x https://127.0.0.1:4445 https://example.com
